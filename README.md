**Time Spent:** 5 hrs coding and 5 hours studying concepts.

**What I Learned:** More DOM getting ingrained in me. I used grid as I was somewhat familiar with it from previous HTML knowledge despite it not being taught yet. 

**What Was Difficult:** Once again, the syntax. It is different than HTML/CSS and takes more time than writing code.
